## Prelude

*This is another prelude long on nostalgia, and short on programming. If that does not interest you, feel free to skip straight to* [FRACTRAN](#fractran).

Conway touched my own life from early days. As I described in [The Eight Queens Problem... and Raganwald's Unexpected Nostalgia](https://raganwald.com/2018/08/03/eight-queens.html):

*My mother had sent me to a day camp for gifted kids once, and it was organized like a university. The "students" self-selected electives, and I picked one called **Whodunnit**. It turned out to be a half-day exercise in puzzles and games, and I was hooked.*

*Where else would I learn about playing tic-tac-toe in a hypercube? Or about liars and truth-tellers? Or, as it happened, about [Martin Gardner][mg]? I suspect the entire material was lifted from his collections of columns, and that suited me down to the ground.*

[mg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner

One of the things we talked about in "Whodunnit" was [Conway's Game of Life][GoL]. I recall hearing about it there, but I also don't recall playing with it much. There was a lot going on, and it's entirely possible that I was too busy falling in love with Raymond Sullyan at age [eleven] to have curiosity left over for John Conway.[^HL][^TSL][^CoL]

I went on to rediscover Conway's Game of Life several times in my life. We talked of in university. And years later, I read William Poundstone's [The Recursive Universe: Cosmic Complexity and the Limits of Scientific Knowledge][ru], and it literally blew my mind:

Along the way, I learned a little about Game Theory. I loved games of all kinds, and I think I spotted [Games of Strategy: Theory and Applications][GoS] in a library and picked it up, thinking it would help my Backgammon.

[GoS]: https://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB149-1.html

That led me to Conway's [On Numbers and Games][onag], and via parallel paths, to [Surreal Numbers]. Like the Game of Life, Surreal Numbers keep popping up unexpectedly, reigniting my interest in how the way we represent data, affords or hinders working with that data.

The subject of numbers and representation leads us to [FRACTRAN].[^elegance][^horton]

## FRACTRAN

In 1987, Conway contributed _FRACTRAN: A SIMPLE UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR ARITHMETIC_ to a special workshop on problems in communication and computation conducted in the summers of 1984 and 1985 in Morristown, New Jersey, and the summer of 1986 in Palo Alto. California. FRACTRAN itself was not an important open problem in the field, but as the editors of the published papers noted:

_Perhaps the most entertaining of all the contributions is Conway's fascinating article on FRACTRAN, a strange collection of numbers, which when operated on in a simple way. yield all possible computations. We begin with his article._
--Thomas M. Cover & B. Gotinath, "Open Problems in Communication & Computation"[^scihub]

[^scihub]: "Open Problems in Communication & Computation" is available on SciHub, or by paying rent to Springer-Verlag. I chose to use SciHub and to simultaneously purchase a used copy of the book online. I don't know how long we'll still be able to buy used books, but I'm taking full advantage of the privilege while we're still permitted to do so.

### our first fractran program

As Wikipedia notes, a FRACTRAN program is an ordered list of positive fractions together with an initial positive integer input *n*. The program is run by updating the integer *n* as follows:

1. for the first fraction *f* in the list for which *nf* is an integer, replace *n* by *nf*
2. repeat this rule until no fraction in the list produces an integer when multiplied by *n*, then halt.

For example, this is a FRACTRAN program for computing any Fibonacci number: `17/65`, `133/34`, `17/19`, `23/17`, `2233/69`, `23/29`, `31/23`, `74/341`, `31/37`, `41/31`, `129/287`, `41/43`, `13/41`, `1/13`, `1/3`.[^snark]

[^snark]: Feel free to use FRACTRAN to ace the programming interview when somene asks for a program to compute `fib(n)`.

All FRACTRAN programs also start with an initial value for *n*. That value is sometimes a constant, and sometimes provided by the user. When it's provided by the user, there is sometimes a need to prepare *n* to make it usable.

In this program's case, to compute `fib(x)` for some value of *x*, we compute `n = 78 * 5^(x - 1)`.

Let's use this program to compute `fib(7)`. We start with `n = 78 * 5^(7-1)`, which is **1,218,750**. We'll follow along for a while to get the feel for what happens:[^debug-fib]

[^debug-fib]: The complete debug output is in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/raganwald/57e9ebf26e3cd2d07aa014e79c1e9748#file-out-md).

- The first fraction in the program is 17/65. 1,218,750 multiplied by 17/65 is 318,750, so we replace 1,218,750 with 318,750 and begin again.
- The first fraction in the program is 17/65. 318,750 leaves a remainder when divided by 65, so we move on.
- The next fraction in the program is 133/34. 318,750 multiplied by 133/34 is 1,246,875, so we replace 318,750 with 1,246,875 and begin again.

We leave it to run for a very long time, and then we see:

- The first fraction in the program is 13/41. 24,576 leaves a remainder when divided by 41, so we move on.
- The first fraction in the program is 1/13. 24,576 leaves a remainder when divided by 13, so we move on.
- The first fraction in the program is 1/3. 24,576 multiplied by 1/3 is 8,192, so we replace 24,576 with 8,192 and begin again.

8,192 is an important number, because *none* of the divisors divide evenly into 8,192. So we see

- The first fraction in the program is 17/65. 8,192 leaves a remainder when divided by 65, so we move on.
- The next fraction in the program is 133/34. 8,192 leaves a remainder when divided by 34, so we move on.
- The next fraction in the program is 17/19. 8,192 leaves a remainder when divided by 19, so we move on.

...

- The next fraction in the program is 13/41. 8,192 leaves a remainder when divided by 41, so we move on.
- The next fraction in the program is 1/13. 8,192 leaves a remainder when divided by 13, so we move on.
- The next fraction in the program is 1/3. 8,192 leaves a remainder when divided by 3, so we move on. None of the demoninators in the program divide evenly into 8,192, so the program halts.

All FRACTRAN programs produce a series of values for *n*, and the result we want must be extracted from them. For our Fibonacci program, the values begin with `1,218,750`, `318,750`, `1,246,875`, and `1,115,625`, and then end with `221,184`, `73,728`, `24,576`, and `8,192`.[^n-fib]

[^n-fib]: The complete list of values of *n* is in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/raganwald/57e9ebf26e3cd2d07aa014e79c1e9748#file-values-of-n-txt).

In the case of Fibonacci, the result we want is the `log2` of the last value for *n*. The last value of *n* is 8,192, and `log2(8,192)` is **13**, the answer we want. The 7th Fibonacci number is 13.

We have now seen the three elements that every FRACTRAN program has:

1. The program itself, a finite list of fractions. This program's list is 17/65, 133/34, 17/19, 23/17, 2233/69, 23/29, 31/23, 74/341, 31/37, 41/31, 129/287, 41/43, 13/41, 1/13, 1/3.
2. An initial value of *n*. This may be a constant, it may be a user-supplied value, or it may be a transformation of a user-defined value. This program's transformation can be expressed in JavaScript as `n => 78 * Math.pow(5, n-1)`.
3. A transformation from the values of *n* into the result we want, encoded the way we want it. In our case, it is something like `values => log2(last(values))` .

### writing a fractran-based fibonacci function in javascript

Writing a FRACTRAN interpreter is very easy. Let's begin by writing a JavaScript Fibonacci function that uses our FRACTRAN program for its implementation. The main thing we'll need to watch out for is that that values of *n* can grow very, very large, so we will want to use big integers, aka "BigInts."

One consequence of working with big integers is that many of the things we depend on for numbers no longer work. For example, `Math.log2(8192) => 13`, but `math.log2(8192n) => TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number`. We'll have to write our own `log2` function.

The same goes for `Math.pow`, we'll have to write our own. Feel free to use these implementations if you like:

```javascript
// Any sufficiently complicated function that loops, contains an ad hoc,
// informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of
// half of Linear Recursion
const log2 = (n) => {
  let result = 0n;

  while (true) {
    // degenerate condition
    if (n === 1n) break;

    // termination conditions
    if (n % 2n === 1n) return;
    if (n < 1n) return;

    //divide and conquer
    ++result;
    n = n / 2n;
  }

  return result;
}

const pow = (base, exponent) => {
  if (exponent < 0n) return;

  let result = 1n;

  while (exponent-- > 0n) result = result * base;

  return result;
}
```

Now go ahead and write your own implementation. Check back when you're done!
